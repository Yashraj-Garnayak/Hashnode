## 🚀 What is Docker?

Imagine you have a **lunchbox (container)** 🍲. Inside, you pack your meal (application + dependencies), and it stays **the same no matter where you take it**. Whether at home, the office, or on a picnic, it works **identically**. That’s what Docker does for applications!

Docker is an **open-source platform** that lets developers **package applications into containers** to ensure they **run the same way on any system**.

**💊 Why Use Docker?** ✅ Eliminates the **"It works on my machine"** issue. ✅ Provides a **consistent** environment. ✅ **Lightweight** compared to Virtual Machines (VMs). ✅ **Faster deployments** with minimal overhead.

---

## 🚀 What is Docker Daemon?

Docker Daemon is the **background service** that manages Docker containers on a system. It listens for **Docker API requests** and handles container management, including **creating, running, stopping, and removing containers**.

### Example Command to Check Docker Daemon Status:

```bash
systemctl status docker
```

---

## 🚀 What is a Docker Container?

A **Docker container** is a **lightweight, isolated environment** that packages an application and its dependencies. Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more efficient than Virtual Machines.

### Example: Running an Nginx Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

**Explanation:** Starts an Nginx container, making the web server available on **localhost:8080**.

---

## 📚 What is a Dockerfile?

A **Dockerfile** is a script containing **instructions** to build a Docker image.

🔄 **Why Use a Dockerfile?** ✅ Automates image-building. ✅ Standardizes deployments. ✅ Version-controlled infrastructure.

---

## 🔧 Writing a Dockerfile (Step-by-Step)

### 📝 **Example Dockerfile for an Nginx Web Server**

```bash
# 1️⃣ Choose a Base Image  
FROM nginx:latest  

# 2️⃣ Set Maintainer Information  
LABEL maintainer="yourname@example.com"  

# 3️⃣ Copy Application Files  
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html  

# 4️⃣ Expose Ports  
EXPOSE 80  

# 5️⃣ Command to Run the Container  
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### 🔄 **Explanation of Dockerfile Instructions**

| Instruction | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `FROM` | Sets the base image (e.g., `ubuntu:latest`) |
| `LABEL` | Adds metadata (e.g., author, version) |
| `COPY` | Copies files from host to container |
| `EXPOSE` | Opens a port for external communication |
| `CMD` | Defines the **default** command when the container starts |

---

## 🚀 Docker Commands Cheat Sheet

### 🚀 **Basic Commands**

#### Pull an Image

```bash
docker pull nginx
```

**Explanation:** Downloads the latest `nginx` image from Docker Hub.

#### List All Images

```bash
docker images
```

**Explanation:** Displays all downloaded images on the system.

#### Run a Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

**Explanation:** Runs an Nginx container, mapping **port 8080 on the host** to **port 80 in the container**.

### 🛠️ **Container Management**

#### Stop a Running Container

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

**Explanation:** Gracefully stops a running container.

#### Remove a Container

```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```

**Explanation:** Deletes a stopped container from the system.

#### View Container Logs

```bash
docker logs <container_id>
```

**Explanation:** Displays logs of a running container.

#### List Running Containers

```bash
docker ps
```

**Explanation:** Shows all active containers.

#### Execute a Command Inside a Running Container

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh
```

**Explanation:** Opens an interactive shell inside the running container.

## 🚀 What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a **tool for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications**. Instead of running multiple `docker run` commands, you can define everything in a `docker-compose.yml` **file** and start all services with a single command.

### Example `docker-compose.yml`

```bash
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
```

### Start All Services

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Explanation:** Starts the **Nginx web server** and a **MySQL database** in separate containers with defined settings.

---

## 🚀 What is Docker Networking?

Docker networking allows containers to communicate **with each other and external systems**. Docker provides different network modes:

### Types of Docker Networks:

1. **Bridge (default)** - Containers can communicate within the same network.
    
2. **Host** - Containers use the host machine's network directly.
    
3. **Overlay** - Used in multi-host Swarm environments.
    
4. **None** - No networking.
    
5. **Macvlan** - Assigns a MAC address to containers for direct network access.
    

### Example: Creating a Custom Network

```bash
docker network create my_network
```

**Explanation:** Creates a custom **bridge network** for containers.

### Connect a Container to a Network

```bash
docker network connect my_network my_container
```

**Explanation:** Now, `my_container` can communicate with other containers in `my_network`.

## 📊 Conclusion

Docker simplifies **application deployment** by packaging everything into **lightweight, portable containers**.

🛠️ **Next Steps:** Try writing your own Dockerfile, setting up a multi-container app with Docker Compose,distroless images and experimenting with Docker networks! 💪
